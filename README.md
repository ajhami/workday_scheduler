Deployed application: https://ajhami.github.io/workday_scheduler/

This repository contains the source files to a workday scheduler. Users can open this application and find a daily snapshot with to-do memos saved for specific workday hours as well as indication of the current date and time. Memos are saved using local storage as to allow the user to come back into the application at any point and find their notes.

The application also utilizes functions from moment.js to keep track of date and time in real time. jQuery is utilized for simpler, more efficient JavaScript.
